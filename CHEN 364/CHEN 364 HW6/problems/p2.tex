\item Problem 2

The maximum possible conversion in this reaction is dictated by the equilibrium relationship. As temperature increases, the maximum possible conversion decreases. In order to maximize the amount of the reactants that are converted, the effluent of the reactor is cooled. The cooling steps bypass the physical limitations of euqilibrium conversion by maintaining lower temperatures such that total conversion increases over multiple reactor stages.
